### Notes:
- **PyTorch Version**: Make sure to choose the correct version of PyTorch compatible with your hardware (CPU or GPU). The provided `torch` version is for CPU; you might need to adjust it if using a GPU.
- **Optional Libraries**: The libraries marked as optional (e.g., `tqdm`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `pyyaml`, `loguru`, `jupyter`, `ipython`) are not essential but can enhance the functionality and usability of your project. Remove them if not needed to keep the dependencies minimal.
- **Version Compatibility**: The versions provided are based on compatibility as of now. Ensure they work with your project's code and update if needed.
-**Uploading File**:Make surenthe audio file is wav form not mp3 form.
Feel free to add or remove packages according to your project's specific needs.
